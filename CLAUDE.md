## Common Commands

### Running Services

```bash
make up                    # Start all services (requires AWS access)
make up-no-trust           # Start central hub only
make up-trusts             # Start trust services only
make down                  # Stop all services
make restart               # Stop and restart all
make build                 # Build all Docker images
make ui                    # Start UI only
```

### Testing

```bash
# From root — run all unit tests across all services
make unit_test

# From root — run flip-ui + flip-api tests
make tests

# From a service directory (e.g., flip-api/)
make test                  # Lint + mypy + pytest (unit + integration)
make unit_test             # Unit tests only
make integration_test      # Integration tests only
make local_test            # Tests without Docker

# Direct pytest invocation
uv run pytest --tb=short --disable-warnings --cov=src/ --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Linting & Type Checking

```bash
uv run ruff check . --fix  # Lint with auto-fix
uv run mypy .              # Static type checking
```

### Documentation

```bash
cd docs && make clean          # Clean built docs
cd docs && make docs           # Build Sphinx HTML documentation
```

### Debugging

```bash
make debug SERVICE=flip-api        # Start a service in debug mode
make debug SERVICE=trust-api       # Available: flip-api, trust-api, imaging-api, data-access-api
make debug-off SERVICE=flip-api    # Stop debug mode
```

### Test Data

```bash
make -C flip-api create_testing_projects   # Create test projects
make -C flip-api delete_testing_projects   # Clean up test data
```

## Workflow Requirements

### Always Use Make Commands

When a `Makefile` target exists for the task at hand, **always use it** instead of running raw commands. Make targets encapsulate the correct flags, environment setup, and command sequences. Key rules:

- Use `make test` (from a service directory) rather than invoking `uv run ruff`, `uv run mypy`, and `uv run pytest` separately — it runs all three in the correct order.
- Use `make unit_test` (from root or service directory) for running unit tests.
- Use `make build` instead of raw `docker compose build`.
- Use `make up` / `make down` instead of raw `docker compose` commands.
- Check each service's `Makefile` for available targets before writing manual commands.

### Always Verify Changes

After making any code changes, **always run verification before committing**:

1. **Identify affected services** — determine which service(s) your changes touch.
2. **Run the service-level test suite** — from the affected service directory:

   ```bash
   make test        # Runs ruff + mypy + pytest (unit + integration)
   ```

   If only unit tests are needed (e.g., no Docker available):

   ```bash
   make unit_test   # Unit tests only
   ```

3. **For cross-service changes**, run the root-level test suite:

   ```bash
   make unit_test   # All services from root
   ```

4. **Fix all failures** before committing — do not commit code that fails linting, type checking, or tests.
5. **For frontend changes** (`flip-ui/`), also run:

   ```bash
   cd flip-ui && npm run lint && npm run test:unit
   ```

### Check If Documentation Needs Updating

After making changes, **always evaluate whether documentation needs to be updated**. Check the following:

| Change Type | Documentation to Review |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| New service or component | `README.md` (root), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Adding a new service section), `docs/source/2_components.rst` |
| New API endpoints | `docs/source/5_api_reference.rst`, service-level `README.md` |
| Changed environment variables | `.env.development.example`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Environment variables section), `docs/source/3_sys-admin.rst` |
| New dependencies or tooling | `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Prerequisites section), service `README.md` |
| Changed Docker/deployment config | `deploy/README.md`, `docs/source/3_sys-admin.rst` |
| New Make targets | `README.md` (root), this file (`CLAUDE.md`) |
| Changed user-facing workflows | `docs/source/4_user-guides.rst` and files in `docs/source/user-guides/` |
| New FL framework features | `docs/source/components/component-fl-nodes.rst` |
| Trust service changes | `trust/README.md`, relevant `trust/*/README.md` |
| New user roles or auth changes | `docs/source/components/component-user-roles.rst` |

Documentation files in this repo:

- **`README.md`** (root) — project overview, quickstart, prerequisites
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — development setup, coding style, PR process
- **`docs/source/`** — Sphinx/ReadTheDocs documentation (`.rst` files)
- **Service-level `README.md`** files — per-service setup and usage (in `flip-api/`, `flip-ui/`, `trust/*/`)
- **`deploy/README.md`** — deployment instructions
- **This file (`CLAUDE.md`)** — AI assistant reference

When in doubt, update the docs. Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.

## Code Style & Conventions

### Python

- **Line length**: 120 characters
- **Linter/Formatter**: Ruff (`select = ['I', 'F', 'E', 'W', 'PT']`)
- **Type checker**: mypy (all code must have type hints)
- **Docstrings**: Google style guide
- **Naming**: snake_case for functions, variables, modules
- **Imports**: Alphabetically sorted (enforced by ruff `I` rule)
- **Source layout**: `src/[service_name]/` per service
- **Test files**: `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- **Test fixtures**: pytest fixtures in `conftest.py`, factory_boy for data generation
- **Dependency injection**: FastAPI `Depends()`
- **Async DB**: asyncpg with async context managers

### JavaScript/TypeScript (flip-ui)

- **Line length**: 120 characters
- **Linter**: ESLint with TypeScript + Vue plugins
- **Components**: PascalCase names, organized in `src/partials/` (reusable) and `src/pages/`
- **State management**: Pinia stores in `src/stores/`
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS utility classes (dark mode via `dark:` prefix)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Cypress (e2e)
- **Icons**: Heroicons (`@heroicons/vue`)

### General

- All files must include the Apache 2.0 copyright header
- Commits must be signed off (DCO): `git commit -s`
- PRs target the `develop` branch
- Branch naming: `[ticket_id]-[task_name]` (e.g., `19-ci-pipeline-setup`)

## Environment Setup

1. Copy env template: `cp .env.development.example .env.development`
2. Install Python deps per service: `cd <service-dir> && uv sync`
3. Install UI deps: `cd flip-ui && npm install`
4. Configure AWS: `aws configure sso` (required for `flip-api` and `make up`)
5. Install AWS Session Manager plugin (for SSH-over-SSM access to AWS hosts)
6. Docker networks: `make create-networks`

### Key Environment Variables

- `FL_BACKEND` — `flower` (default) or `nvflare`
- `DOCKER_FL_API_NAME` / `DOCKER_FL_SERVER_NAME` / `DOCKER_FL_CLIENT_NAME` — derived from `FL_BACKEND` by `deploy/fl_backend.mk`; do not set in `.env*`
- `PROD` — `true` (production), `stag` (staging), unset (development)
- `AES_KEY_BASE64` — encryption key for trust communication
- `TRUST_API_KEYS` — JSON dict of per-trust plaintext API keys for trust-to-hub auth
- `TRUST_API_KEY_HASHES` — hub-side JSON dict mapping trust names to SHA-256 hashes of their API keys
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` — HTTP header name for internal service auth
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` — internal service key for fl-server-to-hub auth (Central Hub only)
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HASH` — hub-side SHA-256 hash of the internal service key
- `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` — public base URL of flip-api (with `/api`); read by flip-ui and trust-api. In prod this is the CloudFront URL.
- `FLIP_API_INTERNAL_URL` — Central-Hub-internal base URL of flip-api (with `/api`); read **only** by fl-server. Must resolve over the Docker network (e.g. `http://flip-api:8000/api`), never the CloudFront URL — CloudFront strips `X-Internal-Service-Key` at the edge.
- `ENFORCE_MFA` — `true` (the `Settings` default; do **not** set in `.env*` files for stag/prod) gates every authenticated route on TOTP enrolment via the app-layer MFA check in `verify_token`. The dev override lives in `deploy/compose.development.yml` (`ENFORCE_MFA=false`) so local development doesn't force enrolment on a burner authenticator app; production-mode compose files inherit the Settings default. Intentionally not in `.env.development.example` or AWS Secrets Manager — the dev override is the only place this flag should appear, and stag/prod leave it untouched. The UI mirrors this flag from `/users/me/mfa/status` and skips the enrolment redirect when it's false.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- **Test**: `test_flip_api.yml`, `test_flip_ui.yml`, `test_trust_*.yml`
- **Build**: `docker_build_*.yml` for each service
- **Infrastructure**: `validate_terraform.yml` (fmt + validate, no AWS creds needed)
- **Security**: `secret-scanning.yml` (TruffleHog + detect-secrets)
- **Docs**: `docs.yml` (Sphinx → ReadTheDocs)
- **PR checks**: `pr_acceptance_criteria.yml`

Run CI locally: `make ci` (uses [act](https://github.com/nektos/act))

### Docker image builds: manual trigger required for branches

**The `docker_build_*.yml` workflows only auto-publish to GHCR on merges to `develop` and `main`.** Branch pushes do NOT build images. If you pin a branch-named tag in a compose file (e.g. `ghcr.io/londonaicentre/flip-api:my-feature-branch`) for prod testing, you must manually trigger the relevant build workflow first via `workflow_dispatch`:

```bash
gh workflow run docker_build_flip_api.yml --ref <branch-name>
gh workflow run docker_build_flip_ui.yml --ref <branch-name>          # only if UI image is consumed; deploy-ui builds locally
gh workflow run docker_build_trust_trust_api.yml --ref <branch-name>
# ...one per service whose image you've pinned
```

Wait for green completion (`gh run list --workflow=docker_build_flip_api.yml --branch <branch>`) before redeploying. The `flip-ui` is rebuilt locally by `make deploy-ui` and does not consume GHCR; the rest do.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

- TruffleHog (secret scanning)
- detect-secrets (with `.secrets.baseline`)
- Large file check (max 1000KB)
- Merge conflict markers, YAML validation, private key detection
- Environment variable validation

Install: `pre-commit install`

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Deployment Models

FLIP supports two deployment models:

1. **Cloud-Only**: Central Hub + Trust services both on AWS EC2
2. **Hybrid/On-Premises**: Central Hub on AWS EC2 + Trust services on a local/on-premises host

Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks over HTTPS. Trust communication payloads are encrypted via `AES_KEY_BASE64`. **All trust communication is outbound** — trusts initiate all connections (task polling at `https://<subdomain>/api/...` via CloudFront → ALB; FL training via the NLB). The Central Hub never makes inbound connections to trusts.

**SSH Access**: Both EC2 instances (Central Hub and Trust) are accessed via AWS SSM Session Manager (`ssh flip` / `ssh flip-trust`). No SSH port is open in any security group. The SSH config aliases are generated by `deploy/providers/AWS/update_ssm_ssh_config.py` with SSM ProxyCommand. Both EC2 instances are in **private subnets** with no public IPs — access is exclusively via SSM.

**Debugging Trust services**: since the Trust EC2 has no inbound ports open, the web UIs and swagger docs are reachable only via SSM port forwarding. One command opens parallel forwards for all of them:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS && make forward-trust
```

This prints the URLs to open in your browser:
- XNAT: `http://localhost:8104`
- Orthanc: `http://localhost:8042`
- trust-api swagger: `http://localhost:8020/docs`
- imaging-api swagger: `http://localhost:8001/docs`
- data-access-api swagger: `http://localhost:8010/docs`
- Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

Ctrl+C stops all forwards.

**FL Service Authentication**: The fl-server (on the Central Hub) authenticates to flip-api using `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` via the `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER` header. This is separate from trust API keys. FL clients (on the trust side) do **not** have Central Hub API credentials — only the fl-server communicates with flip-api. FL clients relay metrics and exceptions to the fl-server, which forwards them to the Central Hub.

**FL Traffic Direction**: FL clients on trusts connect **outbound** to the FL server on the Central Hub via the NLB. The FL server listens on port 8002; FL clients do not listen on any port. No inbound firewall rules are needed on trust hosts for FL traffic.

**Trust Authentication Model**: Trusts authenticate to the Central Hub using per-trust API keys — any machine with the correct `TRUST_NAME`, `TRUST_API_KEY`, and `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` can act as a trust. The hub identifies trusts by API key hash lookup (not by IP address or hostname). Trust registration requires:

1. **Hub-side**: Trust name in `TRUST_NAMES` env var (seeded into DB at startup), API key hash in `TRUST_API_KEY_HASHES`, and hub redeployed with updated secrets
2. **Trust-side**: Matching `TRUST_NAME`, `TRUST_API_KEY`, `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL`, and `AES_KEY_BASE64` in the trust's `.env` file

Keys are generated via `make generate-trust-api-keys` (in `deploy/providers/AWS/`). The `full-deploy-with-local-trust` / `full-deploy-hybrid` targets handle key generation, secrets update, and hub redeployment automatically (both honour `PROD=stag|true`). When using `add-local-trust` standalone, keys must already be configured.

### Docker Compose (Development vs Production)

Compose files live in `deploy/` and are selected by the `PROD` environment variable and `FL_BACKEND`:

| File | Purpose |
| ------ | --------- |
| `compose.development.yml` | Builds from source, volume-mounts code, exposes debug ports |
| `compose.production.yml` | Pulls pre-built images from GHCR (`ghcr.io/londonaicentre/*`) |
| `compose.{env}.flower.yml` | FL backend override for Flower |
| `compose.{env}.nvflare.yml` | FL backend override for NVIDIA FLARE |
| `compose.development.debug.override.yml` | Debug port mappings (port 5678) |

**Development** builds images locally and mounts source for live editing. **Production** pulls tagged images from GHCR and uses AWS Secrets Manager for credentials instead of `.env` files.

When modifying Docker Compose configuration, **always update both development and production compose files** to keep them consistent. Check that:

- New services appear in both `compose.development.yml` and `compose.production.yml`
- Environment variables, ports, and network configurations match across environments
- New FL-backend-specific services appear in both `flower` and `nvflare` variants

### AWS Infrastructure (Terraform/OpenTofu)

Infrastructure-as-code lives in `deploy/providers/AWS/`. Key resources:

| Resource | Purpose |
| ---------- | --------- |
| VPC + subnets | Network isolation (`10.0.0.0/16`, 2 AZs) |
| EC2 instances | Central Hub (`t3.medium`, private subnet) + Trust (`t3.xlarge`, private subnet, optional) |
| RDS PostgreSQL | Managed database (private subnets) |
| ALB | HTTPS termination for UI and API (ACM certificate) |
| NLB | gRPC traffic for FL servers |
| S3 buckets | Model files, federated data, FL app storage |
| Cognito | User pool (`flip-user-pool`) with email auth |
| Secrets Manager | `FLIP_API` secret (AES key, DB password) |
| SES | Email notifications |
| Route53 | DNS records for ALB subdomain |

**Terraform state** is stored remotely in S3 with encryption and DynamoDB locking.

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# From deploy/providers/AWS/
make full-deploy PROD=stag           # Full staging deployment
make full-deploy PROD=true           # Full production deployment
make full-deploy-hybrid PROD=stag LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<ip>   # Hybrid with on-prem trust (staging)
make full-deploy-hybrid PROD=true LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<ip>   # Hybrid with on-prem trust (production)

# Individual steps
make init                            # Terraform init (S3 backend)
make plan                            # Terraform plan
make apply                           # Terraform apply
make plan-cloudfront-certs           # Plan CloudFront viewer + ALB API-origin certs
make apply-cloudfront-certs          # Apply those certs (required before CloudFront distribution)
make deploy-centralhub               # Deploy Central Hub services to EC2 (via SSM)
make deploy-ui                       # Build flip-ui from working tree, sync to S3, invalidate CloudFront
make deploy-trust                    # Deploy Trust services to EC2 (via SSM)
make ssh-config                      # Generate SSH config with SSM ProxyCommand
make status                          # Health checks across all services

# On-premises trust
make add-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<ip>       # Provision on-prem trust via Ansible
```

**UI hosting (CloudFront)**: The flip-ui is served from an S3 bucket behind CloudFront at the canonical subdomain (`stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk` / `app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`). CloudFront forwards `/api/*` to the ALB via a backend-only `api.<subdomain>` DNS name; users and trusts keep using the canonical URL. Runtime config (Cognito IDs, API URL) is injected into a generated `window.js` at deploy time — no env-specific values are committed to the repo. CloudFront is the only supported UI-hosting path: the canonical A-record aliases CloudFront directly, the ALB has no `ec2-instance-ui` target group, and EC2 does not listen on port 443.

### Trust Services Architecture

Each Trust environment (cloud or on-prem) runs:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
| --------- | ------ | --------- |
| trust-api | 8020 | Trust API gateway (polls hub for tasks) |
| imaging-api | 8001 | DICOM image retrieval |
| data-access-api | 8010 | OMOP database queries |
| fl-client | — | Federated learning client (connects outbound to FL server via NLB) |
| XNAT | 8104 | Neuroimaging platform |
| Orthanc | 4242 | DICOM server |
| omop-db | 5432 | Patient cohort database |

On-premises trusts are provisioned via Ansible (`deploy/providers/local/`), which installs Docker and deploys the Trust Docker Compose stack. All trust communication is outbound — no inbound firewall rules are required for trust operation.

### Dev/Prod Consistency Rules

When making infrastructure or deployment changes, **always think through both environments end-to-end**:

1. **Compose files** — update both `compose.development.yml` and `compose.production.yml`. They differ in *how* services run (build-from-source vs GHCR images, source volume mounts vs baked-in code), but the set of services, ports, networks, and functional volume mounts must stay in sync.
2. **Volume mounts and host files** — development mounts files from the local repo. Production mounts files from the EC2 host filesystem. If you add a file bind mount in development, the same file must exist on the production EC2 instance — ensure it is provisioned by the Ansible playbook (`deploy/providers/AWS/site.yml`) or by a Makefile target, and add the corresponding mount in `compose.production.yml`.
3. **FL backend variants** — update both `flower` and `nvflare` compose files if adding services or ports.
4. **Environment variables** — add to `.env.development.example` and document in `deploy/README.md`. Production uses AWS Secrets Manager instead of `.env` files, so also update `deploy/providers/AWS/services.tf` (the `FLIP_API` secret) if the variable is needed at runtime.
5. **Terraform variables** — update `variables.tf` with descriptions and defaults; keep `main.tf` and `services.tf` in sync.
6. **Ansible provisioning** — if production EC2 instances need new directories, files, packages, or data, add tasks to `deploy/providers/AWS/site.yml` (cloud) and `deploy/providers/local/site_local_trust.yml` (on-prem). Key host paths: `/opt/flip/` (app root), `/opt/flip/data/` (FL data/images), `/opt/flip/services/` (FL participant kits), `/opt/flip/omop/` (OMOP database data), `/opt/flip/volumes/` (observability data — Loki, Grafana).
7. **Trust changes** — update both cloud (`deploy/providers/AWS/`) and on-prem (`deploy/providers/local/`) Ansible playbooks so both deployment models stay consistent.

## Security Rules

- Never commit secrets or credentials — pre-commit hooks enforce this
- **SSH-over-SSM for AWS EC2 access** (mandatory):
  - Do NOT expose port 22 in any security group
  - Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for remote access
  - Access via `ssh flip` / `ssh flip-trust` aliases (requires `.ssh/config` generated by `make ssh-config`)
  - Requires: AWS CLI credentials (IAM role), Session Manager plugin installed locally
  - Benefits: Centralized audit via CloudTrail, IAM-based access control, no persistent SSH keys, zero-inbound-port architecture
  - See [Deployment Guide](deploy/providers/AWS/README.md#remote-access-via-ssm-session-manager)
- Never bypass TLS certificate validation (`curl -k` is prohibited)
- Use `AES_KEY_BASE64` for encrypted trust communication
- AWS Cognito for hub authentication, per-trust API keys for trust-to-hub auth
- Internal service key (`INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY`) for fl-server-to-hub auth — separate from trust keys
- FL clients (trust side) intentionally have no access to Central Hub API credentials
- Do not hardcode environment values in Dockerfiles or compose files

## Important: Rules for adding or modifying code

Follow these rules when adding new code or modifying existing code:

1. Follow existing code style and conventions
2. Add or update tests in `tests/` to cover new functionality
3. Run formatters, linters, type checkers, and tests before committing (`make test` or `make unit_test`)
4. Update documentation in `README.md` or `docs/` as needed
5. Commit changes with clear messages referencing related issues or features, NEVER co-sign commits or PRs, all commits
must be signed off by the human author alone (`git commit -s`), as they are the sole responsible for the content and
quality of the code.
6. Ensure that any new dependencies are added to the appropriate `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` files and documented
in the service-level `README.md`.
7. Use the SOLID principles for code organization and design, ensuring that new code is modular, reusable, and maintainable.
8. Measure code coverage and aim for high coverage on new code paths, while also ensuring that critical paths are well-tested.
