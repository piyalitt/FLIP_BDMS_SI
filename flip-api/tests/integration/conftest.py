"""Integration-test scaffolding.

Boots a throwaway Postgres via Testcontainers once per session and rewires
flip-api's module-level engine references at it so:

* the existing ``session`` fixture from ``tests.fixtures.main_fixtures`` (and
  every test depending on it) reads/writes the throwaway DB;
* ``Depends(get_session)`` does the same when tests hit endpoints through the
  FastAPI ``client`` fixture.

Each test gets its own function-scoped ``session`` (overrides the module-scoped
one in main_fixtures) and tables are truncated between tests so test order is
irrelevant. This keeps integration test files free of bring-up boilerplate —
they just request ``session`` (and/or ``client``) and write SQL-shaped
assertions.

    """In-process moto fake for S3, Cognito and SES (B2 — issue #368).

    moto intercepts ``boto3.client(...)`` calls at the botocore layer, so the
    flip-api production code paths in ``utils/s3_client.py``,
    ``utils/cognito_helpers.py`` and the inline ``boto3.client("sesv2", ...)``
    constructions in ``user_services/access_request.py`` and
    ``private_services/imaging_notifications.py`` all hit the moto fake with no
    test-only branches in source.

    Why moto and not LocalStack: ``cognito-idp`` and ``sesv2`` are Pro-only on
    LocalStack (the free tier rejects ``CreateUserPool`` /
    ``CreateEmailIdentity`` outright). moto covers all three in OSS, runs
    in-process so there's no container boot, and the per-region message lists
    on the SES backend (``moto.ses.ses_backends``) make assertion-after-send
    cheap.

    Fake credentials and a stable region are pinned in the environment up
    front: boto3 still demands creds before it'll sign a request, and a
    stable region keeps moto's per-region backends predictable across tests.
    Real-AWS env vars from a developer's shell are intentionally clobbered
    here so a leak from a real account is impossible while the fixture is
    active.
