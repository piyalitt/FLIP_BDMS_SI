"""Unit tests for ``flip_api.domain.schemas.file``.

The ``UploadFileBody.fileName`` validator is the server-side last line
of defence: that string is concatenated into the S3 object key by the
upload route, so a path-traversal token like ``../other-model/x`` or
control characters would let a caller steer the key off the
``{model_id}/`` prefix or smuggle an unexpected object past the
downstream scan/download endpoints. Pin every rejection rule.
