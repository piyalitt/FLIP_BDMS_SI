    Receives and saves training metrics for a given model ID and trust.

    This endpoint is internal-only: it accepts requests from the fl-server on the
    Central Hub (authenticated via INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HEADER), not from trusts.

    Args:
        model_id (UUID): The unique identifier for the model.
        training_metrics (TrainingMetrics): The training metrics to be saved.
        request (Request): The FastAPI request object, used for logging and context.
