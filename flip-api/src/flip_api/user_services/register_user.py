    Register a new user in Cognito.

    Cognito is the source of truth for user identity; we do not mirror users
    in a local table. Role assignment is a separate step (handled by
    ``/api/step/users``). This endpoint writes a ``UsersAudit`` row keyed by
    the new Cognito sub on success.

    Args:
        user_data (IRegisterUser): The user data to register (email + roles).
        request (Request): The FastAPI request object.
        db (Session): The database session.
        token_id (UUID): ID of the authenticated user making the request.

    Returns:
        IUserResponse: Created user data including the new Cognito sub.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the user does not have permission to register a
        user, if the email is already registered, or if Cognito rejects the
        create.
