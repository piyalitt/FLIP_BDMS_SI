    """
    Report whether the caller has an active TOTP authenticator and
    whether this environment requires one.

    Exempt from the MFA gate so a freshly-invited or admin-reset user can
    discover their enrolment state and be routed to the setup page.

    Args:
        request: FastAPI request object, used to resolve the Cognito user
            pool id.
        token_id: ID of the authenticated user (from the bearer token).

    Returns:
        dict[str, bool]: ``{"enabled": <bool>, "required": <bool>}``.
        ``enabled`` reflects whether the caller has a verified and active
        TOTP device; ``required`` mirrors Settings.ENFORCE_MFA so the UI
        can skip the enrolment redirect in dev without a second env var.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 404 if the token's sub does not resolve to a
        Cognito user, 500 on Cognito errors.
