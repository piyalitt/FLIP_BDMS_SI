    Delete a user from Cognito and revoke their role grants.

    DB cleanup (delete role grants + write audit row) commits before the
    Cognito delete so a Cognito failure leaves a Cognito user with no
    app-side authority — preferable to dangling role grants on a deleted
    user. Idempotent: if the Cognito user is already gone, the DB-side
    cleanup still runs so any ghost role grants are reaped.

    Args:
        user_id (UUID): Cognito ``sub`` of the user to delete. FastAPI
            validates the path segment, returning 422 on malformed input.
        request (Request): The FastAPI request object.
        db (Session): The database session.
        token_id (UUID): ID of the authenticated user performing the delete.

    Returns:
        dict[str, Any]: Empty dictionary on success.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If the caller lacks permission or an unexpected error
            (other than a Cognito 404) occurs.
