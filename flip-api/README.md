The **Central Hub API** is the coordination layer for the FLIP platform. It is the primary interface for researchers
and administrators, managing projects, users, federated learning tasks, model retrieval, and cohort queries across
all connected Trust environments.

## Role in the FLIP Platform

The Central Hub API orchestrates the full lifecycle of a federated learning study:

1. **Project management** — create, approve, and track FL projects across participating Trusts
2. **User management** — via AWS Cognito, managing researcher and administrator accounts
3. **Cohort queries** — dispatch OMOP SQL queries to Trust sites and aggregate results
4. **Model coordination** — trigger training jobs, retrieve aggregated models, and store metrics
5. **Audit logging** — record all significant platform events for governance and compliance

It communicates with each Trust's [trust-api](../trust/trust-api/) and stores all state in a PostgreSQL database.

## Deployment

The flip-api is deployed as a Docker container. In the full local stack, it is started via:

```bash
make central-hub   # starts flip-api, the database, and flip-ui
```

or as part of the full platform:

```bash
make up
```

The API is served on the port defined by `FLIP_API_PORT` in [`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example)
(default: `8000`). Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at:

```
http://localhost:<FLIP_API_PORT>/docs
```

## Configuration

The flip-api is configured via environment variables. In development these are set in
[`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example). Key variables include:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region for Cognito and S3 |
| `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` | AWS Cognito User Pool ID |
| `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` | AWS Cognito App Client ID |
| `AES_KEY_BASE64` | Base64-encoded AES-256 key for encrypting trust task payloads |
| `PRIVATE_API_KEY` | Secret key for inter-service authentication between hub and trust APIs |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket for storing models and artefacts |

See [`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example) for the full list of required variables.
