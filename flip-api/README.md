The **Central Hub API** is the coordination layer for the FLIP platform. It is the primary interface for researchers
and administrators, managing projects, users, federated learning tasks, model retrieval, and cohort queries across
all connected Trust environments.

## Role in the FLIP Platform

The Central Hub API orchestrates the full lifecycle of a federated learning study:

1. **Project management** — create, approve, and track FL projects across participating Trusts
2. **User management** — via AWS Cognito, managing researcher and administrator accounts
3. **Cohort queries** — dispatch OMOP SQL queries to Trust sites and aggregate results
4. **Model coordination** — trigger training jobs, retrieve aggregated models, and store metrics
5. **Audit logging** — record all significant platform events for governance and compliance

It communicates with each Trust's [trust-api](../trust/trust-api/) and stores all state in a PostgreSQL database.

## Deployment

The flip-api is deployed as a Docker container. In the full local stack, it is started via:

```bash
make central-hub   # starts flip-api and the database
```

or as part of the full platform:

```bash
make up
```

Before starting the platform, generate per-trust API keys and the internal service key:

```bash
make generate-trust-api-keys        # from repo root
make generate-internal-service-key  # from repo root (also invoked automatically by `make up`)
```

`generate-trust-api-keys` updates `TRUST_API_KEYS` and `TRUST_API_KEY_HASHES` in `.env.development`. `generate-internal-service-key` writes `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` and `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY_HASH` (used for fl-server-to-hub authentication).
See [`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example) for the expected format.

The API is served on the port defined by `API_PORT` in [`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example)
(default: `8080`). Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at:

```
http://localhost:<API_PORT>/api/docs
```

## Configuration

The flip-api is configured via environment variables. In development these are set in
[`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example). Key variables include:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DB_HOST` | PostgreSQL host |
| `DB_PORT` | PostgreSQL port |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | PostgreSQL username |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region for Cognito and S3 |
| `AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` | AWS Cognito User Pool ID |
| `AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` | AWS Cognito App Client ID |
| `AES_KEY_BASE64` | Base64-encoded AES-256 key used to encrypt trust task payloads and project IDs. Shared between hub (encryption) and trusts (decryption) |
| `TRUST_API_KEY_HASHES` | JSON dict mapping trust names to SHA-256 hashes of their per-trust API keys (e.g. `{"Trust_1": "<hash>"}`) — used by the hub to authenticate incoming trust requests |
| `UPLOADED_MODEL_FILES_BUCKET` | S3 bucket for uploaded model files |
| `UPLOADED_FEDERATED_DATA_BUCKET` | S3 bucket for storing models and artefacts |

See [`.env.development.example`](../.env.development.example) for the full list of required variables.

## Testing

Tests are split into `tests/unit/` (no real backing services) and `tests/integration/` (real Postgres / Cognito / S3 / sibling APIs). See [Where does my test go?](../CONTRIBUTING.md#where-does-my-test-go) in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the placement rule.

Run unit tests (no Docker / DB / network needed):

```bash
make unit_test
```

Run integration tests against a throwaway Postgres (Docker required, but no compose stack):

```bash
make integration_test
```

Integration tests use [testcontainers-python](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-python) to start a `postgres:16-alpine` container per test session and tear it down at the end. The schema is created from `SQLModel.metadata` and seeded with permissions / roles / role-permissions in `tests/integration/conftest.py`; per-test tables are truncated between tests. New integration tests just request the `session` (real DB) and/or `client` (FastAPI `TestClient` wired to the same DB) fixtures — no setup boilerplate.

### AWS-touching tests (S3, Cognito, SES)

A session-scoped autouse fixture (`aws_mock` in `tests/integration/conftest.py`) enters [`moto.mock_aws()`](https://github.com/getmoto/moto) for the whole test session, intercepting `boto3.client(...)` calls at the botocore layer. The flip-api production code paths in `src/flip_api/utils/s3_client.py`, `src/flip_api/utils/cognito_helpers.py`, and the inline `boto3.client("sesv2", ...)` constructions in `user_services/access_request.py` and `private_services/imaging_notifications.py` all hit the moto fake with no test-only branches in source.

Per-service helper fixtures bootstrap the state each test needs:

- `s3_buckets` — creates the buckets configured in `Settings` (`UPLOADED_MODEL_FILES_BUCKET`, `SCANNED_MODEL_FILES_BUCKET`, `UPLOADED_FEDERATED_DATA_BUCKET`, `FL_APP_BASE_BUCKET`, `FL_APP_DESTINATION_BUCKET`).
- `cognito_user_pool` — creates a moto user pool + app client and rebinds `Settings.AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` / `AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` to point at them, clearing the `_cognito_client` `lru_cache` so the next call rebuilds against the fresh IDs.
- `ses_send_email_recorder` — captures every `sesv2.send_email` call. moto v5 explicitly raises `NotImplementedError` on `send_email` with `Content.Template`, and every flip-api SES caller uses templated content; the recorder wraps the production-code path up to the SDK boundary so the test asserts the boto3 call shape (`FromEmailAddress`, `Destination.ToAddresses`, `TemplateName`, `TemplateData`). It's the closest approximation to a real SES round-trip moto's coverage allows today.

Why moto and not LocalStack: `cognito-idp` and `sesv2` are Pro-only on LocalStack — the free tier rejects `CreateUserPool` / `CreateEmailIdentity` outright. moto covers all three in OSS and runs in-process, so there's no container boot per test session.

`aws_mock` also pins `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to test-only stub values in the environment for the duration of the session, and clobbers any `AWS_PROFILE` from the developer's shell. Real-AWS credentials are never reachable while the fixture is active.

Run the full suite (lint + mypy + pytest, requires the dockerised dependencies):

```bash
make test
```
