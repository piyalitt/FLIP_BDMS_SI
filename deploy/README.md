# Pre-configurations needed for FLIP Deployment

## Deployment Architecture

### Prerequisites

#### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry

Log in to GHCR to pull pre-built images from CI/CD:

Create a token with `read:packages` scope from GitHub settings.
We recommend following [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

```bash
echo <GITHUB_PAT> | docker login ghcr.io -u <GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin
```

> **Note**: You need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `read:packages` permission.

#### Step 2: Configure AWS CLI SSO

Set up AWS CLI with SSO for authentication:

```bash
aws configure sso
```

if you have already configured SSO, you can then login with:

```bash
aws sso login
```

#### Step 3: Get SSH key configured

Generate an SSH key pair for EC2 instance access:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/host-aws -C "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
```

This key will automatically be uploaded to AWS during deployment and can be found in the AWS console under AWS EC2 > Network & Security > Key Pairs.

See `TF_VAR_flip_keypair` and `TF_VAR_ec2_public_key_path` in the Terraform environment configuration if you need to customize the key name or path.

### Final configuration

#### Verify AWS SES email address

The SES email address will have received a verification link you need to click. Then, to check the email has been verified, log in to the AWS console, navigate to the SES service, and check the Configuration > Identities section.
