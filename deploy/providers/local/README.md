# FLIP Local (On-Premises) Trust Deployment

Ansible playbook and supporting files to provision an on-premises Ubuntu host as a FLIP Trust node. The provisioned host polls the Central Hub (running in AWS) for tasks — all communication is outbound from the trust.

This is the **local provider** counterpart to the [AWS provider](../AWS/README.md), which manages the Central Hub and (optionally) cloud-hosted Trust instances. Together they form the hybrid deployment model described in [docs/hybrid-local-trust-https-plan.md](../../../docs/hybrid-local-trust-https-plan.md).

## Architecture

```sh

  Trusts poll the hub (outbound only)
```

Each local Trust host runs:

| Service | Port | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trust-api | 8000 | HTTP (polls hub outbound) |
| imaging-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal) |
| data-access-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal) |
| fl-client | — | TCP (connects outbound to FL server via NLB) |

## Prerequisites

1. **Operator workstation** — The machine where you run the commands (typically your laptop). It needs:
   - Python 3.12+ and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)
   - Ansible (installed via `uv sync` in `deploy/providers/AWS/`)
   - Terraform outputs available (you must have run `make init` + `make apply` in `deploy/providers/AWS/` first)
   - SSH access to the trust host (if provisioning remotely)

2. **Trust host** — An Ubuntu 22.04+ machine (physical or VM) with:
   - A user account with `sudo` privileges (default: `ubuntu`)
   - SSH access from the operator workstation (if remote), or local access
   - Internet connectivity (to pull Docker images and packages)

3. **AWS Central Hub deployed** — The Central Hub must be running in AWS (required for Terraform outputs, FL participant kits in S3, and NLB security group configuration). See [`deploy/providers/AWS/`](../AWS/README.md).

## Quick Start

All commands are run from the `deploy/providers/AWS/` directory since the Makefile targets there orchestrate both cloud and local infrastructure:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
```

### Recommended end-to-end target (staging hybrid)

```bash
make full-deploy-stag-hybrid LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip> [LOCAL_TRUST_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/trust_key]
```

This wrapper target runs the full AWS + local trust provisioning pipeline, updates the trust configuration in AWS Secrets Manager (per-trust `TRUST_API_KEY`, `AES_KEY_BASE64`, and `TRUST_API_KEY_HASHES`), and redeploys Central Hub so the new secret values are loaded.
You still need to start the local trust stack on the trust host:

```bash
cd trust
env PROD=stag make up-local-trust
```

### Provision a remote trust host (via SSH)

```bash
make add-local-trust \
  LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip> \
  LOCAL_TRUST_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/trust_key
```

### Provision the local machine as the trust host (no SSH)

```bash
# Set the sudo password (fish shell)
set -x ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS (read -s -P 'Sudo password: ')

make add-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>
```

### What `add-local-trust` does

1. Runs the Ansible playbook (`site_local_trust.yml`) which:
   - Installs Docker and required system packages
   - Creates application directories under `/opt/flip/`
2. Downloads the `Trust_2` FL participant kit from S3 and deploys it to `/opt/flip/services/Trust_2/{startup,local,transfer}` on the trust host.
3. Runs a targeted `terraform apply` to:
   - Add security group rules allowing FL traffic from the local trust's public IP

### Post-provisioning manual steps

1. **Start the trust stack** on the trust host:

   ```bash
   cd trust
   env PROD=stag make up-local-trust
   ```

2. **Verify** the trust can poll the hub (check trust-api logs for successful task polling).

## Communication Model

Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks over HTTPS — all communication is **outbound from the trust**. The hub never makes inbound requests to trusts. This simplifies networking: no inbound firewall rules or NAT port-forwarding are needed for the trust API port.

## Trust Authentication

Any machine with the correct credentials can act as a trust — the hub identifies trusts by API key, not by IP address or hostname. The trust's `.env` file must have:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TRUST_NAME` | Must match a name in the hub's `TRUST_NAMES` list (e.g. `Trust_2`) |
| `TRUST_API_KEY` | Per-trust secret key (generated by `make generate-trust-api-keys`) |
| `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` | Hub URL the trust polls (e.g. `https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`) |
| `AES_KEY_BASE64` | Shared encryption key for trust-hub payloads |

**Hub-side prerequisites** (before the trust can connect):

1. `TRUST_NAMES` must include this trust's name
2. `TRUST_API_KEY_HASHES` must contain the SHA-256 hash of this trust's API key
3. The hub must be redeployed with the updated secrets (`make deploy-centralhub`)

The `full-deploy-stag` / `full-deploy-stag-hybrid` targets handle key generation and hub redeployment automatically. When using `add-local-trust` standalone, keys must already be configured.

## Ansible Playbook Details

### `site_local_trust.yml`

The main playbook. It can be run standalone or via the `add-local-trust` Makefile target.

**Required variables** (passed with `-e`):

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trust_public_ip` | Public IP (or hostname) of the trust host | `82.1.2.3` |

**Optional variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flip_dir` | `/opt/flip` | Root application directory |

**Direct usage** (without the Makefile):

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
uv run ansible-galaxy install -r ../../../deploy/providers/local/requirements.yml

uv run ansible-playbook \
  -i <trust-host-ip>, \
  -u ubuntu \
  --private-key ~/.ssh/trust_key \
  ../../../deploy/providers/local/site_local_trust.yml \
  -e trust_public_ip=<public-ip>
```

### `requirements.yml`

Ansible Galaxy dependencies:

- `geerlingguy.docker` — Docker installation role

Install with:

```bash
uv run ansible-galaxy install -r deploy/providers/local/requirements.yml
```

## Home Network Firewall Configuration

### Port Forwarding (NAT)

**No inbound port forwarding is needed.** Trusts poll the hub outbound for tasks, and FL clients connect outbound to the FL server via the NLB. All communication is trust-initiated.

### Dynamic Public IP

The NLB security group allowlists the trust's public IP for FL traffic. If the public IP changes (common with residential broadband), update it:

```bash
TF_VAR_local_trust_public_ip=<new-ip> make -C deploy/providers/AWS plan apply
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Trust not polling hub | Trust stack running? (`docker ps` on trust host). Check trust-api logs for polling errors. |
| `Connection timed out` (FL) | Trust's public IP changed? Update NLB security group. Host/router firewall blocking outbound on port 8002? |
| Firewall blocking outbound | Check host/router firewall allows outbound HTTPS (443) and gRPC (8002) |
| Ansible `Permission denied` | SSH key correct? User has sudo? `ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS` set for local mode? |
