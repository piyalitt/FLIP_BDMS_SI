# FLIP Local (On-Premises) Trust Deployment

Ansible playbook and supporting files to provision an on-premises Ubuntu host as a FLIP Trust node, secured with HTTPS via an nginx-tls sidecar. The provisioned host connects back to a Central Hub running in AWS.

This is the **local provider** counterpart to the [AWS provider](../AWS/README.md), which manages the Central Hub and (optionally) cloud-hosted Trust instances. Together they form the hybrid deployment model described in [docs/hybrid-local-trust-https-plan.md](../../../docs/hybrid-local-trust-https-plan.md).

## Architecture

```sh
        Internet
            │
            |
            │
            ▼
     ┌──────────┐             ┌──────────┐
     │ AWS CH    │             │ On Prem   │
     │ (Central  │-------------│ Router    │
     │  Hub)     │     │       │ NAT fwd   │
     └────┬─────┘     │       └────┬─────┘
          │            │            │
    HTTPS │            │      HTTPS │
          │            │            │
     ┌────▼─────┐     │       ┌────▼────┐
     │ Trust A   │     │       │ Trust B  │
     │ (AWS EC2) │     │       │ (local)  │
     └──────────┘     |       └─────────┘
                       │
              All links use HTTPS
          (self-signed CA + nginx-tls)
```

Each local Trust host runs:

| Service | Port | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **nginx-tls** | `TRUST_API_PORT` (default 8020) | HTTPS (external) |
| trust-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal, behind nginx) |
| imaging-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal) |
| data-access-api | 8000 | HTTP (internal) |
| fl-client | 8002 | TCP (FL server/admin, consolidated) |

## Prerequisites

1. **Operator workstation** — The machine where you run the commands (typically your laptop). It needs:
   - Python 3.12+ and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)
   - Ansible (installed via `uv sync` in `deploy/providers/AWS/`)
   - Terraform outputs available (you must have run `make init` + `make apply` in `deploy/providers/AWS/` first)
   - SSH access to the trust host (if provisioning remotely)

2. **Trust host** — An Ubuntu 22.04+ machine (physical or VM) with:
   - A user account with `sudo` privileges (default: `ubuntu`)
   - SSH access from the operator workstation (if remote), or local access
   - Internet connectivity (to pull Docker images and packages)

3. **AWS Central Hub deployed** — The Central Hub must be running in AWS so that Terraform can provide the CH public IP for firewall rules. See [`deploy/providers/AWS/`](../AWS/README.md).

4. **Home network access** — The ability to configure port forwarding on the border router.

## Quick Start

All commands are run from the `deploy/providers/AWS/` directory since the Makefile targets there orchestrate both cloud and local infrastructure:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
```

### Recommended end-to-end target (staging hybrid)

```bash
make full-deploy-stag-hybrid LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip> [LOCAL_TRUST_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/trust_key]
```

This wrapper target runs the full AWS + local trust provisioning pipeline, updates `trust_endpoints["Trust_1"]` in `FLIP_API`, and redeploys Central Hub so the new secret values are loaded.
You still need to start the local trust stack on the trust host:

```bash
cd trust
env PROD=stag make up-local-trust-stag
```

### Provision a remote trust host (via SSH)

```bash
make add-local-trust \
  LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip> \
  LOCAL_TRUST_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/trust_key
```

### Provision the local machine as the trust host (no SSH)

```bash
# Set the sudo password (fish shell)
set -x ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS (read -s -P 'Sudo password: ')

make add-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>
```

### What `add-local-trust` does

1. Runs the Ansible playbook (`site_local_trust.yml`) which:
   - Installs Docker and required system packages
   - Generates a self-signed CA and server TLS certificate with the host's public IP as SAN
   - Configures UFW firewall to allow `TRUST_API_PORT` and the consolidated FL port `8002` **only from the Central Hub IP**, plus `FLOWER_SUPERNODE_HEALTH_PORT` when `FL_BACKEND=flower`
   - Fetches the local trust CA certificate back to `trust/certs/local-trust-ca.crt`
2. Creates a **CA bundle** (`deploy/providers/AWS/trust-ca.crt`) by concatenating the cloud Trust EC2 CA (generated earlier by `gen-trust-ec2-certs`) with the new local trust CA. This lets `flip-api` verify HTTPS connections to **both** trusts using a single bundle.
3. Downloads the `Trust_2` FL participant kit from S3 and deploys it to `/opt/flip/services/Trust_2/{startup,local,transfer}` on the trust host.
4. Runs a targeted `terraform apply` to:
   - Upload the CA bundle to Secrets Manager (`trust_ca_cert` key in `FLIP_API` secret)
   - Add security group rules allowing FL traffic from the local trust's public IP

### Post-provisioning manual steps

1. **Configure router port forwarding** — Forward `TRUST_API_PORT/tcp` (default 8020) from the router's WAN interface to the trust host's LAN IP. If federated learning traffic must reach the trust host, also forward `8002/tcp`. When `FL_BACKEND=flower`, also forward `9098/tcp` (or your configured `FLOWER_SUPERNODE_HEALTH_PORT`) so the FL API `check_client_status` endpoint can reach the Trust supernode health service.

2. **Update `trust_endpoints["Trust_1"]` in Secrets Manager** — Recommended helper target:

   ```bash
   make set-local-trust-endpoint LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>
   ```

3. **Start the trust stack** on the trust host:

   ```bash
   cd trust
   env PROD=stag make up-local-trust-stag
   ```

4. **Verify (CA-validated)** from the operator workstation:

   ```bash
   make test-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>
   ```

5. **Restart flip-api** on the Central Hub to pick up the new CA cert from Secrets Manager.

## Certificate Model (Critical)

There are two different certificate verification contexts in this hybrid setup:

1. **Central Hub -> Trust API runtime path (must verify CA)**
   - `flip-api` verifies trust HTTPS endpoints using a CA bundle from `FLIP_API.trust_ca_cert`.
   - That bundle is written on CH EC2 to `/opt/flip/certs/trust-ca.crt` and mounted into `flip-api`.
   - The bundle must contain both:
     - cloud Trust EC2 CA (`trust/certs/trust-ca.crt`), and
     - local trust CA (`trust/certs/local-trust-ca.crt`).

2. **Operator/external diagnostics path (must be CA-validated)**
   - `make test-local-trust` uses `--cacert ../../../trust/certs/local-trust-ca.crt`.

If `make test-local-trust` fails with certificate errors, re-run `make add-local-trust` to regenerate/fetch CA certs and rebuild the bundle.

## Ansible Playbook Details

### `site_local_trust.yml`

The main playbook. It can be run standalone or via the `add-local-trust` Makefile target.

**Required variables** (passed with `-e`):

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trust_public_ip` | Public IP (or hostname) of the trust host | `82.1.2.3` |
| `ch_public_ip` | Public IP of the AWS Central Hub EC2 | `18.130.1.2` |

**Optional variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trust_api_port` | `8443` | Port for the nginx-tls HTTPS listener |
| `cert_dir` | `/opt/flip/certs` | Directory for TLS certificates on the trust host |
| `flip_dir` | `/opt/flip` | Root application directory |

**Direct usage** (without the Makefile):

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
uv run ansible-galaxy install -r ../../../deploy/providers/local/requirements.yml

uv run ansible-playbook \
  -i <trust-host-ip>, \
  -u ubuntu \
  --private-key ~/.ssh/trust_key \
  ../../../deploy/providers/local/site_local_trust.yml \
  -e trust_public_ip=<public-ip> \
  -e ch_public_ip=<central-hub-ip> \
  -e trust_api_port=8020
```

### `requirements.yml`

Ansible Galaxy dependencies:

- `community.general` (>= 8.0.0) — UFW module
- `community.crypto` (>= 2.0.0) — TLS certificate generation
- `geerlingguy.docker` — Docker installation role

Install with:

```bash
uv run ansible-galaxy install -r deploy/providers/local/requirements.yml
```

## Home Network Firewall Configuration

### Port Forwarding (NAT)

Configure a port-forwarding rule on the home router:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **External port** | `8020` (or `TRUST_API_PORT`) |
| **Internal IP** | Trust host LAN IP (e.g. `192.168.1.100`) |
| **Internal port** | `8020` |
| **Protocol** | TCP |

For federated learning, also forward:

| External Port | Internal Port | Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `8002` | `8002` | TCP | FL Server/Admin |

### Static LAN IP

Assign a static LAN IP to the trust host (via DHCP reservation on the router or static network config on the host) so port forwarding rules survive reboots.

### ISP / CGNAT Check

Some residential ISPs use Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), which prevents inbound port forwarding. To check:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

The returned IP should match the router's WAN IP. If they differ, contact the ISP to request a public IP or opt out of CGNAT.

### Dynamic Public IP

If the public IP changes (common with residential broadband):

1. Regenerate TLS certificates: `TRUST_HOST=<new-ip> make -C trust generate-trust-certs`
2. Copy certs to `/opt/flip/certs/` and restart `nginx-tls`
3. Re-run `make add-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<new-ip>` to refresh certs and CA bundle
4. Update `trust_endpoints["Trust_1"]` in Secrets Manager: `make set-local-trust-endpoint LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<new-ip>`
5. Update the Terraform security group: `TF_VAR_local_trust_public_ip=<new-ip> make -C deploy/providers/AWS plan apply`

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `Connection refused` on HTTPS test | Trust stack running? (`docker ps` on trust host) |
| `Connection timed out` | Router port forwarding configured? ISP blocking the port? |
| `SSL certificate verify failed` | CA cert mismatch — re-run `make add-local-trust` to regenerate and re-distribute |
| UFW blocking connections | `sudo ufw status verbose` on trust host — verify CH IP is allowed |
| Ansible `Permission denied` | SSH key correct? User has sudo? `ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS` set for local mode? |
