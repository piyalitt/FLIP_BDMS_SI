# FLIP AWS Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible Infrastructure

Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible Infrastructure as Code to deploy the FLIP application stack to AWS.

This provider manages the **Central Hub** (always in AWS) and, optionally, one or more **Trust** instances. Trust services can be deployed in two ways:

| Deployment Model | Trust Location | Managed By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cloud** | AWS EC2 (same account as Central Hub) | This provider (`deploy/providers/AWS/`) |
| **Hybrid / On-Premises** | Any Ubuntu host (home lab, hospital server, etc.) | [`deploy/providers/local/`](../local/README.md) + selected targets in this Makefile |

In both models, trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks over HTTPS — all communication is **outbound from the trust** to the hub. The hub never makes inbound requests to trusts.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI configured** with SSO access (see [deploy README](../../README.md))
2. **Terraform >= 1.13.1** or OpenTofu installed
3. **Python 3.12+**
4. **UV environment manager** installed via [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)
5. **GitHub CLI** installed via [GitHub CLI installation guide](https://cli.github.com/)
6. **SSH key pair** created at `~/.ssh/host-aws` (see [deploy README](../../README.md))
7. **Environment files** configured: (see [deploy README](../../README.md))
   - `.env.stag` (staging) or `.env.production` (production) in project root
   - Service-specific `.env` files (see Environment Configuration section)

### Required AWS Permissions

Your AWS IAM role/user needs the following permissions for provisioning infrastructure:

- **SSM**: `ssm:GetParameter` for fetching AMI IDs
- **EC2**: Full access (VPC, instances, security groups, key pairs, Elastic IPs)
- **RDS**: `rds:CreateDBSubnetGroup`, `rds:CreateDBParameterGroup`, `rds:CreateDBInstance`
- **CloudWatch Logs**: `logs:*`
- **Secrets Manager**: Full access for storing database credentials and API secrets
- **IAM**: Create and manage roles for EC2 instances
- **Application Load Balancer**: Create and manage ALBs
- **SES**: Manage email templates (optional for email functionality)

Managed policies that cover these requirements:

- `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
- `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
- `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`
- `SecretsManagerReadWrite`
- `IAMFullAccess`
- `ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess`
- `AmazonSESFullAccess` (optional)

**Note**: The deployed EC2 instances use minimal IAM permissions (SSM, CloudWatch, and a scoped inline policy for `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on specific secrets) following the principle of least privilege.

## Deployment Workflow

### Full Stack Deployment

The complete deployment process is automated via the `full-deploy` target:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make full-deploy PROD=stag  # For staging
# OR
make full-deploy PROD=true  # For production
```

This command executes the following steps in order:

1. **`github-login`**: Authenticate with GitHub CLI
2. **`aws-login`**: Authenticate with AWS SSO
3. **`init`**: Initialize Terraform with environment-specific S3 backend
4. **`import-all`**: Import existing AWS resources to prevent replacement
5. **`plan`**: Generate and review Terraform execution plan
6. **`apply`**: Apply infrastructure changes
7. **`ssh-config`**: Update `~/.ssh/config` with EC2 instance IPs
8. **`ansible-init`**: Configure EC2 instances with Docker and CloudWatch
9. **`deploy-centralhub`**: Deploy Central Hub services via Docker Compose
10. **`deploy-trust`**: Deploy Trust services via Docker Compose
11. **`status`**: Run comprehensive health checks

### flip-ui on S3 + CloudFront

The UI is served from S3 behind CloudFront at the canonical user-facing subdomain (`stag.flip.aicentre.co.uk` / `app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`). CloudFront also forwards `/api/*` to the ALB, using a backend-only `api.<subdomain>` DNS name that only CloudFront uses — trusts and users never see it. CloudFront is the only supported UI-hosting path; there is no legacy EC2 UI container or ALB UI target group to fall back to.

**Subsequent UI deploys**: just `make deploy-ui PROD=stag|true` — builds the UI from the working tree, regenerates `window.js`, syncs to S3, invalidates CloudFront. No Terraform involved.

### Manual Step-by-Step Deployment

For debugging or selective deployment, run individual steps:

```bash
# 1. Login to AWS
make aws-login

# 2. Bootstrap the Terraform backend bucket once, if needed
make create-backend

# 3. Initialize Terraform (uses the configured S3 backend)
make init

# 4. Import existing resources (prevents replacement errors)
make import-persistent

# 5. Plan changes
make plan

# 6. Apply infrastructure
make apply

# 7. Configure SSH access
make ssh-config

# 8. Setup EC2 instances with Ansible
make ansible-init

# 9. Deploy services
make deploy-centralhub
make deploy-trust

# 9. Check status
make status
```

### Deployment to Different Environments

**Staging:**

```bash
make full-deploy PROD=stag
```

**Production:**

```bash
make full-deploy PROD=true
```

The `PROD` variable determines which environment files are loaded:

- `PROD=stag` → Uses `.env.stag`, `flip-api/.env.stag`
- `PROD=true` → Uses `.env.production`, `flip-api/.env.production`

#### AWS profile aliases

The Makefile guards refuse to apply unless `AWS_PROFILE` matches the expected profile for the chosen environment. Defaults are the short logical names `prod`, `stag`, and `dev` — add these aliases to `~/.aws/config` so commands like `AWS_PROFILE=stag make plan` work without thinking about account numbers:

```ini
[profile prod]
sso_session = FLIP
sso_account_id = <prod-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
region = <aws-region>
output = json

[profile stag]
sso_session = FLIP
sso_account_id = <stag-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
region = <aws-region>
output = json

[profile dev]
sso_session = FLIP
sso_account_id = <dev-sso-account-id>
sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
region = <aws-region>
output = json
```

Replace each `<…>` with the matching value from the FLIP AWS account directory (kept out of the public repo).

If your local profile names differ, override the defaults via `PROD_AWS_PROFILE`, `STAG_AWS_PROFILE`, or `DEV_AWS_PROFILE` (in your env file or on the make command line).

**Dev account (Cognito + SES only):**

The dev AWS account runs only the services that cannot reasonably run locally (Cognito for auth, SES for email). A separate, minimal Terraform root lives in [`dev/`](./dev/README.md) and calls the same `modules/cognito` and `modules/ses` as this stack, so a change to either service lands in both environments from one place. The dev stack reuses `.env.development` — the same env file the local Docker Compose dev stack consumes — so there is no extra file to maintain.

The dev stack has its own Makefile; drive it from the `dev/` directory:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS/dev
make create-backend  # one-time, if the backend bucket needs bootstrapping
make init            # one-time, or after backend config changes
make plan
make apply
```

See [`dev/README.md`](./dev/README.md) for the one-time `terraform import` workflow that pulls the manually-created dev Cognito pool into state.

### Terraform module layout

```
deploy/providers/AWS/
├── main.tf / services.tf       # prod + stag stack root
├── modules/
│   ├── cognito/                # shared: pool, domain, client, seed users
│   ├── ses/                    # shared: sender identity, transactional templates
│   ├── secgroup/               # shared: security-group wrapper
│   └── trust_ec2/              # prod/stag only
└── dev/                        # dev-account root (calls cognito + ses modules)
```

The Cognito and SES resources used to live at the root of the prod/stag stack. `services.tf` and `main.tf` ship `moved` blocks that re-anchor the old root addresses onto the new `module.cognito.*` / `module.ses.*` paths, so any state still on the old layout self-heals on the next plan — no manual `terraform state mv` needed. `scripts/import-resources.sh` already targets the module addresses, so a fresh import lands in the right place too.

### Destroy Infrastructure

The destroy process preserves critical resources (Cognito, Secrets, S3) while safely removing infrastructure:

```bash
make destroy
```

**What gets destroyed:**

- Trust EC2 instance
- Central Hub EC2 instance
- Application Load Balancer
- RDS database (with skip-final-snapshot)
- VPC, subnets, security groups, NAT gateway
- IAM roles and policies
- Elastic IPs

**What gets preserved:**

- Cognito User Pool and users (authentication data)
- Secrets Manager secret (FLIP_API configuration)
- S3 bucket (application data)

### Status Checking

The deployment includes a comprehensive Python-based status checker:

```bash
make status
```

This validates:

- ✅ Terraform state and outputs
- ✅ VPC, subnets, and security group configurations
- ✅ EC2 instance health (Central Hub and Trust)
- ✅ RDS database connectivity
- ✅ Secrets Manager access
- ✅ S3 bucket accessibility
- ✅ Cognito User Pool configuration
- ✅ Docker services on EC2 instances
- ✅ HTTP endpoint availability
- ✅ SSH connectivity
- ✅ CloudWatch Logs configuration

### Accessing Trust Services (XNAT, Orthanc, Swagger Docs)

The Trust EC2 is in a private subnet with no inbound ports open. All Trust web UIs and API swagger docs are reachable via AWS Systems Manager (SSM) port forwarding.

**Prerequisites** (one-time setup):

1. AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure sso`)
2. AWS SSM Session Manager plugin installed:
   ```bash
   curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o /tmp/session-manager-plugin.deb
   sudo dpkg -i /tmp/session-manager-plugin.deb
   ```

**Open all port forwards in one command:**

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make forward-trust
```

This prints a list of URLs you can paste into your browser:

| Service | Local URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XNAT | `http://localhost:8104` | Neuroimaging platform UI |
| Orthanc | `http://localhost:8042` | DICOM server UI |
| trust-api swagger | `http://localhost:8020/docs` | Trust API documentation |
| imaging-api swagger | `http://localhost:8001/docs` | Imaging API documentation |
| data-access-api swagger | `http://localhost:8010/docs` | Data access API documentation |
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3000` | Observability dashboards |

Press Ctrl+C to stop all forwards. The Central Hub UI and API are accessed directly via the public ALB domain (e.g. `https://app.flip.aicentre.co.uk`) — no port forwarding needed.

## Hybrid Deployment: Adding an On-Premises Trust

To connect a local (on-premises) Trust host to the AWS Central Hub:

Recommended orchestration target (staging):

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS
make full-deploy-stag-hybrid LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip> [LOCAL_TRUST_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/trust_key]
```

Or run provisioning directly:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS

# Remote host (via SSH)
make add-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip> LOCAL_TRUST_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/trust_key

# Local machine (no SSH)
set -x ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS (read -s -P 'Sudo password: ')
make add-local-trust LOCAL_TRUST_IP=<public-ip>
```

After provisioning, complete the manual steps printed by the target:

1. Start the trust stack on the host: `cd trust && env PROD=stag make up-local-trust`
2. Verify the trust can poll the hub (check trust-api logs for successful task polling)

Full details are in the [local provider README](../local/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis

First, run the automated status check script to identify issues:

```bash
make status
```

This will automatically diagnose:

- AWS resource health
- Network connectivity
- Application endpoint availability
- Docker container status
- System resource usage

Review the output for failed checks and follow the specific troubleshooting steps below.

## Architecture

### Services

The platform supports a cloud-only setup (Central Hub + Trust on AWS) or a hybrid setup (Central Hub on AWS + Trust on-premises). Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks — all communication is outbound from the trust.

1. **flip-ui (Frontend)**: Served as static assets from an S3 bucket behind CloudFront at the canonical subdomain. See the [flip-ui on S3 + CloudFront](#flip-ui-on-s3--cloudfront) section.

2. **Central Hub EC2**: Hosts the main application services (but **not** the UI — that lives in CloudFront)
   - flip-api (Backend API)
   - fl-api-net-1 (Federated Learning API for Network 1)
   - fl-api-net-2 (Federated Learning API for Network 2)
   - fl-server-net-1 (Federated Learning Server for Network 1)
   - fl-server-net-2 (Federated Learning Server for Network 2)

3. **Trust EC2** (cloud model): Hosts trust-related services (automatically provisioned)
   - trust-api (polls hub for tasks)
   - imaging-api
   - data-access-api
   - fl-client-net-1 (FL Client for Network 1)
   - fl-client-net-2 (FL Client for Network 2)
   - XNAT (medical imaging platform)
   - Orthanc (DICOM server)
   - OMOP database

4. **On-Premises Trust** (hybrid model, optional): Same trust services running on a local host
   - Provisioned via [`deploy/providers/local/`](../local/README.md)
   - Polls the Central Hub over the internet via HTTPS (outbound only)

![AWS architecture](docs/AWS.png "AWS architecture")

### Central Hub Infrastructure

- **VPC**: Custom VPC with public/private subnets
- **Central Hub EC2**: Single t3.medium instance in a **private subnet**, running Docker containers (UI, API, FL services)
- **Trust EC2**: Separate t3.xlarge instance in a **private subnet**, running Trust services via Docker Compose
  - Deployed using custom Terraform module (`modules/trust_ec2`)
  - Automatic Docker and Docker Compose installation via user_data
  - Automatic Docker network creation for inter-service communication
  - No inbound ports open — access via SSM (`ssh flip-trust`) and SSM port forwarding for XNAT/Orthanc debugging (`make forward-trust`)
- **ALB**: Application Load Balancer for traffic routing
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL 15 managed database (EOL: October 2027)
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring for both EC2 instances
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage for API secrets and database credentials
- **S3 Backend**: Remote state storage with environment-specific buckets

### Trust Infrastructure

Trust services can run on AWS EC2 or on-premises. Both models use the same Docker Compose stack. Trusts poll the Central Hub for tasks — all communication is outbound from the trust.

**Cloud Trust (AWS EC2)** — deployed using the `trust_ec2` Terraform module:

- Automated Docker and Docker Compose installation
- Trust compose stack deployment via user_data script
- Automatic Docker network creation for inter-service communication
- Runs in a private subnet with no inbound ports — XNAT and Orthanc accessible only via SSM port forwarding for debugging

**On-Premises Trust** — provisioned via `make add-local-trust` and the Ansible playbook in [`deploy/providers/local/`](../local/README.md):

- Same Docker Compose stack, running on a local Ubuntu host
- No inbound port forwarding or firewall rules needed — all trust communication is outbound

### Port configuration

| Port | Service | Status | Purpose |
| ------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **22** | SSH | 🔴 **CLOSED** | Not exposed — remote access is via SSM Session Manager tunnel (see below) |
| **80** | HTTP | 🟢 **OPEN** | ALB traffic |
| **3000** | FLIP UI | 🟢 **OPEN** | Frontend application |
| **8000** | FLIP API | 🟢 **OPEN** | Backend API |
| **8001** | FL API | 🟢 **OPEN** | Federated learning API |
| **8002** | FL Server | 🟡 **CONDITIONAL** | gRPC (open to trust IPs only) |
| | | | Trust API: no inbound port needed (trusts poll the hub outbound) |

### Remote Access via SSM Session Manager

EC2 instances are accessed through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager — port 22 is **not** open in any security group. SSH traffic is tunnelled through the SSM agent running on each instance, so no bastion host or inbound firewall rule is needed.

**Prerequisites**

- AWS CLI authenticated for the correct account and region:

  ```bash
  export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>   # e.g. FlipDeveloperAccess-046651569599
  export AWS_REGION=eu-west-2         # must match the region where instances are deployed
  aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE
  ```

- [AWS Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) installed (minimum version 1.2.319.0):

  **macOS:**

  ```bash
  brew install session-manager-plugin
  brew upgrade session-manager-plugin  # Update if already installed
  ```

  **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

  ```bash
  curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o "session-manager-plugin.deb"
  sudo dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
  ```

  **Verify installation:**

  ```bash
  session-manager-plugin --version  # Should output version >= 1.2.319.0
  ```

- SSH key at `~/.ssh/host-aws` (configured in Step 3 of [Pre-configurations README](../README.md#step-3-get-ssh-key-configured))

**Updating `~/.ssh/config`**

After `terraform apply`, run:

```bash
make ssh-config
```

This calls `update_ssm_ssh_config.py`, which reads the EC2 instance IDs from Terraform outputs and writes `Host flip` / `Host flip-trust` blocks like the following into `~/.ssh/config`:

```text
# Managed by FLIP - SSH over SSM Session Manager
Host flip
    HostName i-0123456789abcdef0
    User ubuntu
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/host-aws
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
    ProxyCommand aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p' --region eu-west-2 --profile <your-profile>
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-flip-%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 10m
```

**Connecting**

```bash
ssh flip        # Central Hub
ssh flip-trust  # Trust EC2
```

Both aliases resolve through the SSM tunnel — no public IP or open port 22 is needed. If your AWS session has expired, re-run `aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE` before connecting.

**Troubleshooting SSM Access**

| Problem | Diagnostics | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `Unable to locate credentials` | `aws sts get-caller-identity` returns error | Run `aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE` to refresh session |
| `SessionManagerPlugin not found` | `command -v session-manager-plugin` returns nothing | Install plugin: `brew install session-manager-plugin` (macOS) or see prerequisites above |
| `[ERROR] SessionManagerPlugin is not installed` | Session manager plugin is missing or outdated | Upgrade plugin: `brew upgrade session-manager-plugin` or download latest version |
| `InvalidInstanceID.NotFound` | SSH attempts to connect but fails | Verify instance exists: `terraform output Ec2InstanceId` and `terraform output TrustEc2InstanceId` |
| `AccessDeniedException` | `aws ssm start-session` returns access denied | Check EC2 instance IAM role has `ssm:StartSession` and `ec2messages:*` permissions (Terraform should have created this) |
| `Connection timeout` (hanging) | SSM tunnel hangs without error | Check security group allows NLB ingress from NAT Gateway (port 8000-8005); verify instances are running: `aws ec2 describe-instances` |
| `Unable to connect to SSM endpoint` | Connection fails immediately | Verify AWS_REGION matches deployment region: `echo $AWS_REGION` should match `eu-west-2` (or your region) |
| `Bad ProxyCommand` in ~/.ssh/config | SSH config syntax error | Re-generate config: `make ssh-config` and verify it looks like the example above |

**Testing Connectivity**

```bash
# Test SSM session directly (before trying SSH)
aws ssm start-session --target $(terraform output -raw Ec2InstanceId)

# Should open an interactive shell. Run `uname -a` to verify connectivity, then `exit`.

# Then test SSH
ssh flip  # Should connect via SSM tunnel
```

## Email Templates

All email templates are stored as standalone HTML files under `templates/`, organised by service. Both Terraform and the Python test utility load from the same files, ensuring a single source of truth.

### Template Structure

```sh
deploy/providers/AWS/
├── templates/
│   ├── cognito/
│   │   ├── invite.html                      # Temporary password invitation
│   │   ├── password_reset_code.html         # Password reset with verification code
│   │   └── password_reset_link.html         # Password reset with direct link
│   └── ses/
│       ├── flip-access-request.html         # Access request notification
│       ├── flip-access-request.txt          # Plain-text fallback
│       ├── flip-xnat-credentials.html       # XNAT credential notification
│       └── flip-xnat-credentials.txt        # Plain-text fallback
├── services.tf                              # Cognito config - loads cognito/ templates via file()
├── main.tf                                  # SES config - loads ses/ templates via file()
├── test_email_templates.py                  # Test utility for all templates
```

### How Templates Are Loaded

**Cognito templates** (services.tf):

```hcl
email_message = file("${path.module}/templates/cognito/invite.html")
```

**SES templates** (main.tf):

```hcl
html = file("${path.module}/templates/ses/flip-access-request.html")
text = file("${path.module}/templates/ses/flip-access-request.txt")
```

Changes to template files are automatically picked up on next `terraform apply` or test run.

### Template Placeholders

**Cognito templates** use single-brace placeholders substituted by AWS Cognito:

| Placeholder | Replaced By | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{username}` | Cognito username (email) | <john.smith@example.com> |
| `{####}` | 6-digit temporary password or verification code | 123456 |
| `{flip_alb_subdomain}` | ALB domain from Terraform var | flip-app.example.com |
| `{reset_link}` | Password reset link with token | <https://flip.../reset?token=xyz> |

**SES templates** use double-brace (Mustache) placeholders substituted at send time:

| Placeholder | Replaced By | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{{name}}` | Requestor's name | access-request |
| `{{email}}` | Requestor's email | access-request |
| `{{purpose}}` | Access request purpose | access-request |
| `{{trust_name}}` | Trust name | xnat-credentials |
| `{{project_name}}` | XNAT project name | xnat-credentials |
| `{{project_id}}` | XNAT project ID | xnat-credentials |
| `{{username}}` | XNAT username | xnat-credentials |
| `{{password}}` | XNAT password | xnat-credentials |

### Quick Local Testing

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS

# Test all templates and generate HTML previews
python3 test_email_templates.py

# View in browser with local HTTP server
python3 test_email_templates.py --serve
# Open http://localhost:8000/flip_email_invite.html

# Test with custom data
python3 test_email_templates.py \
  --username "user@health.org" \
  --subdomain "flip-stag.example.com"
```

The validation script checks:

- HTML structure and syntax
- Placeholder substitution for both Cognito and SES templates
- FLIP branding colors (#61366e, #9452A8)
- Required text elements present
- Generates browser-viewable preview files

### Testing Emails End-to-End

After deploying, test that emails are delivered correctly by using the **Register User** workflow in FLIP. Registering a new user through the platform triggers the Cognito invitation email with the temporary password. This is the simplest way to verify the templates render correctly in a real email client.

### Email Client Compatibility

| Client | Support | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Gmail Web | Full | CSS gradients supported |
| Outlook Web | Full | CSS gradients with fallback |

### SES Prerequisites

Before testing emails:

1. **Verify SES Email** in AWS Console (SES → Configuration → Identities)
2. **Sandbox Mode** (default): can only send to verified email addresses. Request production access in SES console.
3. **Check Send Quota**: `aws ses get-account-sending-enabled --region <aws-region>`

### Troubleshooting Email Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Email gradients don't render | Most clients support gradients; solid color fallback in template |
| Button not clickable | Some clients disable links for security; check email client settings |
| Text wraps awkwardly | Tables use responsive max-width: 600px (standard) |
| Colors wrong in dark mode | Test in both light/dark modes; colors are contrast checked |
| Logo not loading | Verify the image URL is accessible (hosted on GitHub raw content) |
| Email not delivered | Check SES verification status and sandbox mode restrictions |

### Making Template Changes

1. **Edit template file** in `templates/cognito/` or `templates/ses/`
2. **Test locally**: `python3 test_email_templates.py` (verify all 5 pass)
3. **Review**: Check generated `email_previews/*.html` files in browser
4. **Deploy**: Changes are picked up on next `terraform apply`
