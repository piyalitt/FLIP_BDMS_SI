# Dev-account Terraform root

This directory holds the Terraform stack for the **dev AWS account**. It deploys only the services that cannot reasonably run on a developer workstation:

- **Cognito** — user pool, hosted-UI domain, app client, seed admin/researcher users
- **SES** — verified sender identity and the three FLIP transactional email templates

Everything else (VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB, NLB, Route53, ACM, S3, IAM, CloudWatch) is intentionally **not** part of this stack; local development runs those services via Docker Compose in this repository's `deploy/` root compose files. The prod/stag stack at `deploy/providers/AWS/` is the source of truth for every non-dev environment.

The Cognito and SES resource definitions are shared with the prod stack via the modules under `deploy/providers/AWS/modules/{cognito,ses}/`, so any change to either service lands in both environments from the same code.

## Prerequisites

1. An AWS SSO profile for the FLIP dev AWS account configured via `aws configure sso`. By default the Makefile expects `AWS_PROFILE=dev` and refuses to run if it sees the prod or stag profile. Add a short alias to `~/.aws/config`:

   ```ini
   [profile dev]
   sso_session = FLIP
   sso_account_id = <dev-sso-account-id>
   sso_role_name = <sso-role-name>
   region = <aws-region>
   output = json
   ```

   Replace each `<…>` with the value from the FLIP AWS account directory.

   If your local profile names differ, override `DEV_AWS_PROFILE` (and/or `PROD_AWS_PROFILE` / `STAG_AWS_PROFILE` for the refusal guard) in `.env.development` or on the make command line.
2. A Terraform state bucket reachable from the dev account. The state **key** is hard-coded to `flip/dev/terraform.tfstate`; the bucket name comes from `FLIP_TFSTATE_BUCKET_NAME` in `.env.development`. If you need to create/bootstrap that bucket, run `make create-backend` from this directory.
3. A populated `.env.development` at the repo root. This is the same file the local Docker Compose dev stack uses — no second env file to maintain.

### Variables read from `.env.development`

| Variable | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | dev SSO profile; also guarded against prod/stag account IDs |
| `AWS_REGION` | region for the dev Cognito + SES resources |
| `SES_VERIFIED_EMAIL` | SES sender identity; also defaults the seed admin email |
| `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` | initial password for the seed admin (and researcher, if set) |
| `FLIP_TFSTATE_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket for `flip/dev/terraform.tfstate` |
| `flip_cognito_admin_email` (optional) | overrides the seed admin email if you want it distinct from `SES_VERIFIED_EMAIL` |
| `flip_cognito_researcher_email` (optional) | set to create a second seed user; leave unset to skip |

`.env.development.example` already declares most of these; add whatever's missing. The file is git-ignored.

## Usage

All commands are run from this directory. The dev Makefile loads `.env.development`, guards against the prod/stag AWS accounts, and talks to the dev-only Cognito + SES Terraform root.

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS/dev
make create-backend  # one-time, if the backend bucket needs bootstrapping
make init            # one-time, or after backend config changes
make plan            # preview
make apply           # deploy
make status          # terraform state list
make destroy         # refused while prevent_destroy is set
```

## First-time setup

The dev Cognito + SES resources are Terraform-managed from day one. There is no import workflow — the stack creates every resource it needs.

### Joining an already-bootstrapped dev account

If a colleague has already run `make apply` against the shared dev account, there is nothing for you to create:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS/dev
make init          # pulls providers, wires up the shared S3 backend
make plan          # should report "No changes"
terraform output   # Cognito pool ID, app client ID, domain, SES sender ARN
```

Copy the outputs into your `.env.development` (`CognitoUserPoolId`, `CognitoAppClientId`, `CognitoDomain`) and you are ready to run the local Docker Compose stack against real Cognito.

### Bootstrapping a fresh dev account

Use this the first time the dev account is provisioned, or after a clean-slate reset:

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS/dev
make create-backend  # creates the S3 state bucket (idempotent; safe to re-run)
make init
make plan            # should only propose additions
make apply
```

Post-apply:

1. **SES sender verification** — AWS emails `SES_VERIFIED_EMAIL` a verification link. Click it. Until you do, SES will refuse to send.
2. **Cognito seed users** — Cognito emails the admin (and researcher, if configured) an invite with a temporary password. First sign-in forces a password change.
3. **Read the outputs** — `terraform output` gives the IDs you need for `.env.development`.

### Rebuilding from scratch

To wipe the dev stack and start over: `terraform destroy` is refused by the `prevent_destroy` lifecycle blocks on the shared Cognito / SES modules (those blocks exist to protect the prod pool, which uses the same module). Instead:

1. Delete the resources manually in the AWS console / CLI (user pool domain, user pool, SES templates, SES identity).
2. `terraform state rm` each resource from the dev state, or delete the state object at `s3://$FLIP_TFSTATE_BUCKET_NAME/flip/dev/terraform.tfstate` for a full reset.
3. Re-run the **Bootstrapping a fresh dev account** flow above.

## Day-to-day use

```bash
cd deploy/providers/AWS/dev
make plan       # preview changes
make apply      # deploy
make status     # list resources under terraform management
```

## Relationship to the prod/stag stack

- `deploy/providers/AWS/` — prod + stag (VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB, NLB, ACM, S3, IAM, and Cognito + SES via modules)
- `deploy/providers/AWS/dev/` — **this directory**, only Cognito + SES via the same modules
- `deploy/providers/AWS/modules/{cognito,ses}/` — single source of truth for both envs

A change to the Cognito config (token lifetimes, MFA mode, email templates) goes in the module and rolls out to both environments via each stack's own `apply`. A change that should land in only one environment goes in that stack's root (via module input variables).
