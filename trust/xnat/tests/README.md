# XNAT Anonymization Tests

Tests for `trust/xnat/xnat/config/anon_script.das`, the FLIP site-wide
DICOM anonymization script.

## What this covers

- **Static checks** (`test_anon_script_static.py`) — parse the `.das` file
  and assert that PHI tags FLIP must handle on every study (Patient ID,
  Patient Name, SOP/Study/Series UIDs, etc.) all have an explicit rule.
  Catches future regressions where someone deletes a rule.
- **Synthetic DICOM PHI checks** (`test_anon_script_phi.py`) — build
  in-memory DICOM datasets populated with PHI in every tag the script
  references, run a Python interpreter for the `.das` rule subset used
  by FLIP, and assert each PHI tag is removed, replaced, or hashed.

The tests do not stand up XNAT or DicomEdit. They validate the FLIP
authored ruleset against synthetic studies so a regression in the
script is caught in CI without a heavyweight integration environment.

## Running

```bash
make unit_test    # ruff + mypy + pytest
make test         # alias of unit_test
```

Run from `trust/xnat/tests/` or via `make -C trust/xnat/tests unit_test`.

## When to update

If you add a tag to `anon_script.das`, also add it to the
`PHI_TAGS_REQUIRED` allowlist in `test_anon_script_static.py` (if it is
a tag FLIP guarantees handling for) and to the synthetic study fixture
in `conftest.py`.
