# XNAT

This is a very simple development environment to enable new users of XNAT to interact with the tool in a local environment, using Orthanc as as the mock PACS.

## Docker Swarm

XNAT is deployed using Docker Swarm (both locally and on EC2). This is because Swarm provides overlay networking, resource constraints, and restart policies needed for XNAT services.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Swarm must be initialized before running XNAT: `docker swarm init`
- Overlay networks are created automatically by Make targets

**How it works:**
- `make up` / `make down` use `docker stack deploy` / `docker stack rm` under the hood
- The stack definition is in `xnat-docker-compose/docker-compose-stack.yml`
- EC2 deployments reuse the same Swarm targets (`up-xnat-1-ec2` delegates to `up-xnat-1`)

## Setup

Note you need Orthanc running in order to startup XNAT and configure it properly (see [orthanc](../orthanc/)).

### Download plugins

During development, you will need to download the following XNAT plugins. In production, the XNAT Docker image comes with the plugins installed.

Make sure to always use the correct version of the plugins that are compatible with the XNAT version specified. Check the plugin's compatibility matrix for more information (for example, see [DQR Plugin Compatibility Matrix](https://wiki.xnat.org/xnat-tools/dqr-plugin-compatibility-matrix)).

You can use the Makefile command to download the plugins. From this folder, run

```sh
make xnat-plugins-download
```

The following table lists the compatible versions of the plugins for the XNAT version `1.9.3` used in this environment.

| Plugin                          | Version for XNAT 1.9.3  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Container Service Plugin        | 3.7.3                   |
| Batch Launch Plugin             | 0.9.0                   |
| DICOM Query-Retrieve Plugin     | 2.2.0                   |
| OHIF Viewer Plugin              | 3.7.1                   |

###  Steps

Use the Makefile in this folder and run

```sh
make xnat-reset # this will cleanup previous data, plugins and configurations
make up
```

Once XNAT is up, configure XNAT using the below (only needs to be run once). In a separate terminal, run:

```sh
make xnat-configure
```

The `xnat-configure` command will configure XNAT by creating the service account, changing the default admin password, configuring the SCP receiver, registering PACS, etc. It will also configure dcm2niix in the container service plugin.

If successful, you will be able to log in to XNAT with the service account credentials (specified in the root `.env` file) and see the registered PACS in the DICOM Query-Retrieve plugin.

## Importing data

Use the Imaging API to import data from Orthanc to XNAT.

This can also be done manually from XNAT:

* At the top of the homepage, select the **Browse > All Projects** tab.
* Open your project.
* Click on **Import from PACS** on the right-hand sidebar.
* Select **Orthanc** as your **Source PACS** (the selected SCP Receiver should default to **XNAT:8104**).
* [Query PACS](https://wiki.xnat.org/xnat-tools/using-dqr-searching-the-pacs-and-importing-data#UsingDQR:SearchingthePACSandImportingData-Querying/SearchingforImageSessions).

## Troubleshooting

### [`FIXED`] Issue with receiving data from PACS (Orthanc) -- 'Error: Cannot import' when going to 'Import Studies from PACS' in a project page

* Go to Administer > Site Administration > DICOM SCP Receivers > select XNAT > Change identifier to 'dqrObjectIdentifier' and enable custom processing.
* This was not being configured correctly

### [`FIXED`] Failed container launch: org.mandas.docker.client.exceptions.DockerRequestException: Request error: GET unix://localhost:80/images/json: 200

Container service plugin 3.4.3 is incompatible with Docker version 25 and above. This is a known issue (<https://groups.google.com/g/xnat_discussion/c/2kh3J-p_8bE>). See plugin release notes for 3.5.0 <https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/container-service/src/master/CHANGELOG.md>. I was running Docker version 28.0.1, build 068a01e.

At the time this was fixed by installing newer version of the plugin (3.6.2). This meant installing a newer XNAT (1.9.3), after checking the compatibility matrix <https://wiki.xnat.org/container-service/container-service-compatibility-matrix#ContainerServiceCompatibilityMatrix-ContainerServiceCompatibilitywithXNAT>

Also installed newer Batch Launch Plugin and DQR Plugin due to compatibility matrices.

### [`FIXED`] Container can't find data

Likely due to not having set path translation correctly -- this is now handled automatically.
