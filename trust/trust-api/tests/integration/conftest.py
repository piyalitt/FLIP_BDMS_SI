"""Integration-test scaffolding for trust-api → data-access-api → omop-db (B3, issue #369).

Brings up a Compose stack containing a vanilla Postgres seeded with the OMOP fixture and
a freshly-built data-access-api, then runs trust-api code in-process. The handler under
test (``handle_cohort_query``) is invoked directly so the trust-api → data-access-api
hop is a real HTTP call — no ``make_request`` mocking. The downstream hub callback
(``POST /cohort/results``) is caught by an in-process stub HTTP server because B3 is
explicitly scoped to exclude flip-api involvement (that's the C-series job).

Conventions:

* The stack is session-scoped: building data-access-api once amortises uv-sync cost
  across the whole suite. Container ports are ephemeral; tests look them up via the
  ``data_access_api_url`` fixture instead of hard-coding.
* ``_patch_endpoints`` is autouse so every test gets the right URLs without ceremony.
  It rewrites the module-level constants captured at import time in ``task_handlers``
  rather than relying on env vars, because the trust-api conftest has already loaded
  Settings before this file runs.
