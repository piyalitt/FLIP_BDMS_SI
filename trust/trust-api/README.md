The **trust-api** is the gateway service deployed at each participating healthcare Trust site. It polls the FLIP
Central Hub for tasks and coordinates local operations — cohort queries, model training, and imaging project
management — without exposing patient data externally.

## Role in the FLIP Platform

The trust-api acts as the local orchestrator at each Trust:

1. **Cohort queries** — polls for and executes OMOP SQL queries from the Central Hub, delegates to [data-access-api](../data-access-api/), and returns aggregated statistics
2. **Imaging projects** — creates projects in XNAT via [imaging-api](../imaging-api/) in response to approved FL studies
3. **Audit** — logs all operations locally for governance purposes

The trust-api polls the [flip-api](../../flip-api/) (Central Hub) for tasks. It does not accept inbound requests from the hub or expose an external user interface.

## Deployment

The trust-api is deployed as part of the Trust-side stack. In the local test environment it starts as part of:

```bash
make up-trusts   # trust services for both mock Trusts
```

or the full stack:

```bash
make up
```

API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at the port defined by `TRUST_API_PORT` in
[`.env.development.example`](../../.env.development.example):

```
http://localhost:<TRUST_API_PORT>/docs
```

## Configuration

Key environment variables (set in [`.env.development.example`](../../.env.development.example)):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TRUST_NAME` | Name of this Trust instance (must match `Trust.name` in hub DB, e.g. `Trust_1`) |
| `DATA_ACCESS_API_URL` | Internal URL of the data-access-api |
| `IMAGING_API_URL` | Internal URL of the imaging-api |
| `CENTRAL_HUB_API_URL` | URL of the Central Hub API (for task polling) |
| `PRIVATE_API_KEY` | Secret key for authenticating with the Central Hub |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Polling frequency in seconds (default: 5) |

## Scaling Assumptions

The trust-api task poller is designed to run as a **single replica per trust**. The central hub's
task-claim endpoint does not use row-level database locking, so running multiple poller replicas
for the same trust would cause duplicate task execution.

If horizontal scaling is needed, the hub endpoint (`GET /tasks/{trust_name}/pending`) must be
updated to use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to ensure each task is claimed by exactly
one replica.
