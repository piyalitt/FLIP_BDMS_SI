"""Integration-test scaffolding for data-access-api → omop-db (B3, issue #369).

Mirrors ``trust/trust-api/tests/integration/conftest.py`` — same Compose stack, same
seed file, same key — but the tests here drive the data-access-api ``/cohort`` routes
directly without going through trust-api. This catches schema / SQL-template / auth
regressions that only show up with a real Postgres backend.
